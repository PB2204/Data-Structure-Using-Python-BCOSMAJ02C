Practice Questions on Arrays

    Single-Dimensional Arrays:

        1) Write a Python function to find the largest element in a single-dimensional array.
        2) Implement a Python function to reverse a single-dimensional array in place.
        3) Write a Python function to check if a given element exists in a single-dimensional array.

    Multi-Dimensional Arrays:

        1) Create a 2D array (matrix) and write a Python function to find the sum of all elements in the matrix.
        2) Implement a Python function to transpose a given 2D array.
        3) Write a Python function to perform matrix multiplication on two given 2D arrays.

Practice Questions on Sparse Matrices

    Sparse Matrix Representations:

        1) Write a Python function to convert a dense 3x3 matrix to a sparse matrix using the list of tuples representation.
        2) Implement a Python function to convert a sparse matrix represented as a list of tuples back to a dense matrix.

    Operations on Sparse Matrices:

        1) Write a Python function to add two sparse matrices (represented as dictionaries of keys).
        2) Implement a Python function to multiply two sparse matrices (represented as dictionaries of keys).
