# Data Structure Using Python - BCOSMAJ02C - Exam Preparation

Welcome to my repository for the **Data Structure** course (Course Code: BCOSMAJ02C) preparation. This repository contains all the notes, code, and solutions I have written while preparing for my 2nd semester exam. The course focuses on understanding various data structures and algorithms, analyzing their performance, and applying them to solve complex problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days to help track progress and make it easier to find specific topics...
